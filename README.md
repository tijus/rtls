# RTLS
Real Time Location System (RTLS) is a prototype model supporting the hardware infrastructure based on radio frequency identification device. This project is deviced to interpret hexadecimal radio signals coming out of rfid through radio readers and antennas to study the unusual behavior carried out by the fishermen at sea-shore. The main objective of this project focuses on learning the suspicious behaviour from the login and logout incidents of the fishermen and tracking them for maintaining sinister activities like smuggling, terrorism and piracy.
The software part of this project has been provided with their source code. It consist of two parts.
1. Python based stand-alone system for interpreting and decoding hexadecimal signals and storing it into the database. This is done by using socket programming and tkinter based UI design.
2. The second part of this project is the admin-panel developed in php. This system assist in analysing behavior through graphs and reports generated at the admin end.
